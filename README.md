# About pyspark-vn.vitk 

Vitk - A Vietnamese Text Processing Toolkit, is the third release of a Vietnamese text processing toolkit, which is called "Vitk", developed by [Phuong LE-HONG](http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh) at College of Science, Vietnam National University in Hanoi.

However, vn.vitk readily scalable for large data processing, build on top of Apache Spark. This working as command line tools, base on Spark running background, and cannot using as programming.

**pyspark-vn.vitk** is a small snippet code, modified source code of **vn.vitk** (custom version [vn.vitk-3.0.jar](lib/vn.vitk-3.0.jar)) to run on PySpark, using py4j calling to vn.vitk's Java code.

See the tutorial here in Vietnamese.

# Converted to PySpark 

* Tokenizer - See [pyspark-Tokenizer](pyspark-Tokenizer.ipynb)

# How to contribute

1. Fork the project on Github
2. Create a topic branch for your changes
3. Ensure that you provide documentation and test coverage for your changes (patches wonâ€™t be accepted without)
4. Create a pull request on Github (these are also a great place to start a conversation around a patch as early as possible)

### * Using Jupyter Notebook
See my blog how to using Notebook with Spark: http://blog.duyetdev.com/2016/09/chay-apache-spark-voi-jupiter-notebook.html

### ** Submit vn.vitk-3.0.jar to Spark in Notebook

```
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS="notebook --NotebookApp.open_browser=False --NotebookApp.ip='*' --NotebookApp.port=8880"
export SPARK_HOME=~/spark-1.6.2-bin-hadoop2.6 # Path to home of Spark

$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --jars=./lib/vn.vitk-3.0.jar
